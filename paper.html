	The concept of "document" has been defined[by whom?] as “any concrete or symbolic indication, 
	preserved or recorded, for reconstructing or for proving a phenomenon, whether physical or mental" 
	(Briet, 1951, 7; here quoted from Buckland, 1991). A much-cited article asked "what is a document[?]"
	and concluded this way: “The evolving notion of ‘‘document’’ among (Jonathan Priest). Otlet, Briet, 
	Schürmeyer, and the other documentalists increasingly emphasized whatever functioned as a document 
	rather than traditional physical forms of documents. The shift to digital technology would seem 
	to make this distinction even more important. Levy’s thoughtful analyses have shown that an emphasis 
	on the technology of digital documents has impeded our understanding of digital documents as documents 
	(e.g., Levy, 1994[2]). A conventional document, such as a mail message or a technical report, exists 
	physically in digital technology as a string of bits, as does everything else in a digital 
	environment. As an object of study, it has been made[by whom?] into a document. It has become 
	physical evidence by those who study it. Documents are sometimes classified as secret, private or public.
	They may also be described as a draft or proof. When a document is copied, the source is referred to as 
	the original. There are accepted standards for specific applications in various fields, such as:
    Academic: thesis, paper, journal Business and accounting: Invoice, quote, RFP, Proposal, Contract, 
	Packing slip, Manifest, Report detailed & summary, Spread sheet, MSDS, Waybill, Bill of Lading (BOL), 
	Financial statement, Nondisclosure agreement (NDA) or sometimes referred to as; Mutual nondisclosure 
	agreement (MNDA)Law and politics: summons, certificate, license, gazette Government and industry: 
	white paper, application forms, user-guide.
