	The concept of "document" has been defined[by whom?] as “any concrete or symbolic indication, 
	preserved or recorded, for reconstructing or for proving a phenomenon, whether physical or mental" 
	(Briet, 1951, 7; here quoted from Buckland, 1991). A much-cited article asked "what is a document[?]"
	and concluded this way: “The evolving notion of ‘‘document’’ among (Jonathan Priest). Otlet, Briet, 
	Schürmeyer, and the other documentalists increasingly emphasized whatever functioned as a document 
	rather than traditional physical forms of documents. The shift to digital technology would seem 
	to make this distinction even more important. Levy’s thoughtful analyses have shown that an emphasis 
	on the technology of digital documents has impeded our understanding of digital documents as documents 
	(e.g., Levy, 1994[2]). A conventional document, such as a mail message or a technical report, exists 
	physically in digital technology as a string of bits, as does everything else in a digital 
	environment. As an object of study, it has been made[by whom?] into a document. It has become 
	physical evidence by those who study it. Documents are sometimes classified as secret, private or public. They may also be described as a draft or proof. When a document is copied, the source is referred to as the original.
	There are accepted standards for specific applications in various fields, such as:
    Academic: thesis, paper, journal
    Business and accounting: Invoice, quote, RFP, Proposal, Contract, Packing slip, Manifest, Report detailed & summary, Spread sheet, MSDS, Waybill, Bill of Lading (BOL), Financial statement, Nondisclosure agreement (NDA) or sometimes referred to as; Mutual nondisclosure agreement (MNDA)
    Law and politics: summons, certificate, license, gazette
    Government and industry: white paper, application forms, user-guide
    Media and marketing: brief, mock-up, script Such standard documents can be created based on a template.
	The page layout of a document is the manner in which information is graphically arranged in the document 
	space (e.g., on a page). If the appearance of the document is of concern, page layout is generally the 
	responsibility of a graphic designer. Typography deals with the design of letter and symbol forms, as 
	well as their physical arrangement in the document (see typesetting). Information design focuses on the 
	effective communication of information, especially in industrial documents and public signs. Simple text 
	documents may not require a visual design and may be handled by an author, clerk or transcriber. Forms 
	may require a visual design for the initial fields, but not to fill out the forms.</p>
